# Hello There! :wave:
### My name is FFranza :running:
 I am currently a college student and working on a multitude of projects on the side that can help me improve and expand my current knowledge. :sleeping:

From looking into, creating, then tearing apart Ransomware to creating security patches for specific operating systems, I love interacting with both the hardware and software of any devices! :computer: :hammer:

One thing I pursue is further delve and understand complex theory so that the plans I have I have in my head can logically make sense and then be pushed to reality!  :older_man:
