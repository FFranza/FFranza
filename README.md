# Hello There!
### My name is FFranza
 I am currently a college student and working on a multitude of projects on the side that can help me improve and expand my current knowledge.

From looking into, creating, then tearing apart Ransomware to creating security patches for specific operating systems, I love interacting with both the hardware and software of any devices!

One thing I pursue is further delve and understand complex theory so that the plans I have I have in my head can logically make sense and then be pushed to reality!
